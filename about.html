            <p>Dairy King was founded as an 'ice cream café' project for a College and Career Awareness class (a business and marketing one). It has four founders: William Bohrer, Sebastian King, Ezekiel Riemer, and Harrison Alderman. They came up with the name as a joke reference to *Dairy Queen&copy;, a popular fast food chain. Today, Dairy King is not in operation, as we have only served ice cream on May 19, 2023, this website still serves as a public archive of our work.</p>
            <small>*Dairy King is in no way, shape, or form affiliated with Dairy Queen&copy;. This project was created merely for educational purposes, and will always stay that way. Our copyright (MIT license) is open-source, and merely gives evidence of our original work.</small>
